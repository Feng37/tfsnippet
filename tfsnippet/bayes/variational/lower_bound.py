"""Estimators to compute the variational lower bound.

The variational lower bound is a certain kind of estimators using variational
methods.  It is mainly used to compute the approximated log-likelihood of
a Bayesian network, given the observed variables, as well as the prior and
posterior of latent variables.

    """SGVB estimator for the variational lower bound.

    The SGVB estimator[1], if given observed variable `x` and latent variable
    `z`, where the posterior of `x` is represented by `p(x|z)`, the prior of
    `z` is represented by `p(z)` and the approximated posterior of `z` is
    represented by `q(z|x)`, then it computes the variational lower bound by:

        .. math::
            \\log p(x)
                &\\geq \\log p(x) - \\text{KL} \\left(q(z|x) \\| p(z|x) \\right)

    Note that SGVB can only be applied on continuous variables which can be
    re-parameterized.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model : collections.Iterable[StochasticTensor]
        List of stochastic tensors, representing the posterior of observed
        variables and the priors of latent variables.

    variational : collections.Iterable[StochasticTensor]
        List of stochastic tensors, representing the approximated posteriors
        of latent variables.

    axis : int | list[int] | tf.Tensor
        The dimension(s) of samples, which should be averaged in order
        to compute the expectation of variational lower bound.

        If not specified, then the expectation will not be computed.

    name : str
        Optional name of this operation.

    Returns
    -------
    tf.Tensor
        The computed variational lower bound.
