    """Open or re-open a variable scope.

    When using `tf.variable_scope` to re-open an existing variable scope, the
    original name scope will not be open.  Instead a different name scope will
    be opened under the current name scope.

    This method thus fixes this issue, by ensuring to open the original name
    scope if a variable scope is re-opened, if `unique_name_scope` is False.

    Notes
    -----
    This method does not support `default_name`, which is used to suggest
    a name template for choosing a unique variable scope name, used in
    `tf.variable_scope`.  It opens exactly `name_or_scope`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name_or_scope : str | tf.VariableScope
        The name of the scope, or the variable scope object.

    pure_variable_scope : bool
        Whether or not to open a pure variable scope?

        If set to True, a pure variable scope will be opened without
        changing the current name scope. (default is False)

    unique_name_scope : bool
        Whether or not to open a unique name scope?
        This argument will be ignored if `pure_variable_scope` is True.

        If set to True, a unique name scope will be opened.
        Otherwise the original name scope of the variable scope will be
        reopened. (default is True)

    reuse : None | bool
        Whether or not to reuse the variables in opened scope?

    initializer, regularizer, caching_device, partitioner, custom_getter, dtype
        Other parameters for opening the variable scope.

    Yields
    ------
    tf.VariableScope
        The opened variable scope.
